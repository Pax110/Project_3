                      Small businesses make up more than sixty per cent of the
                      retail sector in Calgary. Local businesses generate about
                      four times more economic activity than larger
                      corporations. And support for local businesses means
                      support for local jobs. Money stays local not only does a
                      dollar go further when spent at a local level, it also
                      keeps on giving. Over half of every $100 earned by local
                      businesses ends up recirculating in the Calgary economy.
                      Itâ€™s a win-win for our neighbourhood businesses when you
                      think local.You help out the environment Less time and
                      resources shipping products grown and made nearby means
                      fewer emissions are associated with every purchase. Local
                      foods, which support area farmers, can be even more
                      beneficial.
